            <p> What Is Printing?</p>
          </div>

          <div class="ans">
            <p>
              Printing is a process for mass reproducing text and images using a master form or template.The history of
              printing can be traced back to thousands of years ago, with the earliest forms of
              printing being used to create patterns on cloth. However, it was not until the invention of paper
              in China around the 2nd century AD that printing began to be used to reproduce text.
              Woodblock printing was the earliest form of printing on paper. It involved carving a block of
              wood with the text or image to be printed, and then inking the block and pressing it onto a sheet
              of paper.
              Movable type was invented in China in the 11th century. It involved casting individual letters
              from a Mold, and then assembling the letters into words and lines. Movable type made it much
              faster and easier to produce printed materials than woodblock printing.

            <p> Why Printing is important?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="ans">
            <p>Printing has had a profound impact on society. It has made it possible to disseminate knowledge and
              information more widely, and has helped to fuel the growth of literacy and education. Printing has also
              played a major role in the development of democracy and
              freedom of expression.
              Here are some of the key milestones
              in the history of printing:
              Today, printing is a global industry
              that produces billions of pages of
              printed materials each year. Printing
              is used to produce a wide range of
              products, including books, newspapers, magazines, brochures, catalogues, packaging, and labels</p>
